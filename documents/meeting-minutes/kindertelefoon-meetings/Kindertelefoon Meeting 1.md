## New Business
### *Usability of the prototype design for the trainer portal*<br>
The interface may be too complex for trainers, too many numbers. Kindertelefoon does prefer the single page overview over having different tabs, but we should enable users to change belief values in more intuitive ways than just input fields, e.g. through arrows or dropdowns. Additionally, the use of color helps trainers understand belief value changes. We should consider using red and green where this would be helpful (since we are using orange for ‘bad’ right now). Kindertelefoon also thinks the chat widget is too small. According to the client (Mohammed Al Owayyed), being able to hide certain features may help to declutter the portal.

### *Chat history page*<br>
The feedback/chat history page would be useful to compare previous chats to the current one. They also mentioned it would be useful to show progress on certain 'skills' that the counsellor possesses. This is too complex for the moment, and we will most likely not get involved with this as the master's students are already working on a direct feedback system.

### *Balance between research and usage by Kindertelefoon*<br>
Current design is more useful for research (i.e. Mohammed Al Owayyed) than it is for Kindertelefoon, might have to look into how we can balance working for the research group and making a product for Kindertelefoon or discuss with the client whether we should focus on only one aspect (due to how short our project is).<br>
Optimal path graph looks too technical for the people at Kindertelefoon, we might have to abstract it to make it actually useful for the trainers. Again, the issue that our time is limited and that we won't be able to make something useful for both research and the company.

### *Bugs*<br>
There are some bugs in the code that prevent correct parsing of the users replies to the chatbot. Ayrton is working on fixing those bugs. However, since we are separate project groups with separate repositories, we will likely have to fix them ourselves as well.
