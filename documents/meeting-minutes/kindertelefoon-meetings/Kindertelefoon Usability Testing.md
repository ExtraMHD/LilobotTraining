## Setup
The user tests requires 2 volunteers to try out our application. One is supposed to be the learner, and the other the trainer. We prepared a list of tasks for both roles. The quality of our application is assessed by the ease with which these tasks are executed by the users. Since there were 2 KT representatives present in the meeting, we planned to have each of them fill in one of the roles. However, one volunteer could not get the application to work on their local machine, so A. Braam took over the role of learner.

The following lists are the tasks that the learner and the trainer had to perform, and how successfully the actions were performed by the users.


### Trainer
- Signing up: The trainer successfully signed up in the expected time.
- Upgrading to a trainer account: the trainer successfully upgraded their account. When they were told to 'upgrade from learner to teacher', they first navigated to the trainer portal, but then managed to find the user settings page.
- Issues occurred concerning the username case sensitivity. The learner's username was entered incorrectly as a result.
- Optimal path generation is unclear and unintuitive to the trainer because of the technical nature of the application (e.g. nodes in the graph are not clearly identified as buttons related to messages)
- The arrows to allow easier manual updating of belief values were found to be helpful
- Disabling auto-sending and using the options for message interception were easily found and used
- Info boxes were not really used

### Learner
- successfully starts chat as a learner.
- did not accept the join request at first because the popup did not appear due to case sensitivity. They went to the user settings page instead.
- the learner is able to use the chat because they are already familiar with Lilobot.
- When asked to access the chat history page, they clicked on 'Training Portal' first (which should not be available to learner's since access rights still need to be defined) and then went back to 'ChatWithLilobot'. They finally clicked on the profile and found the chat history.
- Harder task for the learner: whenever they are asked to do something related to trainers (e.g. upgrading their account) their first inclination is to go to the Trainer's Portal instead of the user settings.

### Both
- account deletion was intuitive

### Additional feedback from the Trainer
The trainer thinks that as a trainer they would get lost with seeing so many numbers on the screen. Everyone in KT is aware of what the phase model is but they still did not understand what to do with the optimal path graph. The trainer also mentioned it would be helpful to see which belief changes, but since they is not familiar with the model, they don't really undersand how beliefs work.

### Additional feedback from the Learner
The learner thinks that the menu is well designed and that the app itself is quite intuitive once you get used to it. However, the chat history page is too hard to find because intuitively, it should be easily reachable from the chat itself.
