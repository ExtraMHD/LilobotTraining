## Agenda Items

### Demo
Sten showed a small demo of the application we have so far, which included every merge of sprint 1 and an experimental version of viewing a learners chat widget on the trainer portal.

### Midterm Presentation
We need to plan the midterm presentation in week 5 or 6 with Ruben, Mo and Ivo. Make sure that everyone is available either online or in-person. It would be nice if we could reserve a room ourselves (e.g. in the library), otherwise we need to give a notice to Ruben a few days in advance so that he can reserve a room for us in building 28.

During the midterm presentation, we need to talk about the original planning, and about decisions we have made and why, and show a demo of what we currently have. It can be a bit shorter than the final presentation, 10-15 minutes and 5 min question round. 

### Weight vs Time Estimate on GitLab Issues
We asked if we need to put weights on issues, on top of already using time estimates. According to Ruben, it's fine to only use time estimates. What matters is that we have some way to compare issues. 

## Feedback from TA

### Path Finding Feasability
Don't spend too much time on path finding, since it is more research than software engineering.

### MoSCoW
TA asked how far we think we are in the MoSCoW requirements at this point. Our (Sten's) estimate was 40-50%. TA says we should keep an eye on this. If we run out of things to do before the project is over, we need to discuss with the client to get more requirements. It's ok to need more requirements, but it's bad to run out and have nothing to do.

## Next Steps

### TU Write Next Deadline
Next week on Tuesday there is a deadline for TU Write [Assignment 6: Rubric Introduction and Improved Introduction (individual)](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folder_submit_files.d2l?db=104327&grpid=0&isprv=0&bp=0&ou=499412).

### Plan Midterm Presentation
Find a date, time and location for the Midterm Presentation in week 5 or 6 where we + Ruben, Mo and Ivo are available. It should take ~1h.
