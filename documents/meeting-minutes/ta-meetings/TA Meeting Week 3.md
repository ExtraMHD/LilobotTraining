## Feedback on the Project Plan 

### Feedback on styling
- Do not put the student numbers on the report. Put names in alphabetical order in the front page.
- Put back ticks for opening quotes in LaTeX.
- Phrase requirements consistently, rather than sometimes using user stories and other times not.
- After the start of a chapter, have a section introduction and then start the sub-section.
- Appendices should be on the next page.

### Feedback on the Problem Analysis
- Problem statement: state the problem first, not the solution. The problem is NOT "we are going to build this", but rather "the interface is unclear" (for example). Try to find the underlying problem, i.e. why does the client want us to build this?
- Without background knowledge on how the BDI model works, the reader cannot understand what the 'optimal path' is among other things. Explain more about how the chatbot works.
- Focus is on what the client wants from us, i.e. the set-up. For the requirements, focus on the software. The setup part should be mentioned as something the client wants from us, but it should not be the main focus of the project.
- It is up to us to decide what the Must haves, Should haves and Could haves are. The client just has to agree with them. So anything not software engineering-related, i.e. Rasa migration and server hosting, we can discuss with the client to downgrade to a Should have if it turns out to be infeasible. The course staff would agree with us needing to work primarily on Software Engineering.

### Feedback on Risk Analysis
- In the risk analysis, the risk should not be the final grade. Any discussion regarding the grade should be left out of the report/project plan alltogether. Instead of saying "the grade will be lower", think about why the grade will be affected (i.e. we might not have enough features implemented, thus not being able to complete a chunk of our should/could haves and thus leaving the client unsatisfied). 

### Feedback on Requirement Analysis
- Rasa migration and hosting on a server are non-functional requirements, they are things we do as "side-effects".
- Explain why we left out won't haves.
- Mention the European Regulations with regard to privacy (GDPR).

## Feedback on the Project Approach
- Focus on why we made some decisions: why do we use Scrum? Why do we organize requirements using the Moscow method? Justify this by either explaining or/and using references. 

## New Business

### Table of Contents
- Can put any section you want on the Table of Contents, it is not final.

### Final Report 
- Do some sort of user study to get some feedback on the application/user interface and include feedback on the report.
- For the final report we can condense things from the project plan more. In the start of the report we should come back to the most important points of the project plan, i.e. if a big issue from the risk analysis comes up during the project, explain this and how we were able to overcome it. 
- Think about what we already want to put in the final report (rough outline, does not have be final).

## Next Steps

### New writing assignment
- New assignment due on **TUESDAY (16/5/23)**, related to the Ethcis section. We will already write a section for the project on why we made certain design choices, and ethical implications.

### Using and crediting someone else's checkstyle 
- You can borrow checkstyle from the Internet as long as you cite the source in the comments.

### Uploading Meeting Agendas
- **We should upload the meeting agendas _beforehand_ from now on.**
