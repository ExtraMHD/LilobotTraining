## More requirements

- Deviations

## Feedback from TA
- When it comes to adding new requirements, make sure they contribute to something that is visible in the final product.
For instance, refactoring code does not count as a requirement.
- Peer reviewing each other's work is a nice exercise to do once in a while. This is something to take into account as we 
shouldn't leave writing the report to the very end.
- You can always have a look at the rubric for the final presentation on Brightspace (also for the midterm presentation).

## Midterm presentation
- Make sure to sketch some context (also for the final presentation, as it is public and anyone can watch it).
- Midterm presentation is just for feedback, it doesn not contribute to the final grade.

## Next Steps
 - Implement new requirements
 - Brainstorm more requirements in case we run out
 - Review pending MRs and merge them for the demo we will show in the Midterm presentation
