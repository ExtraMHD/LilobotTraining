### Changing the ordering of active desires
The correct ordering of desires as described in Grundmann's thesis is the following (ordered by ID): D1 -> D2 -> D3 -> D4 -> D5.
However, the code contradicts this statement as the desires are stored in a `Set` connected to the agent, making the order of 
intentions random. We assumed this to be an unintentional mistake in the original code, and thus we changed the ordering. Our client 
told us to add documentation regarding this change in the report, including how it was implemented and the reasoning behind it. 

### Server setup documentation
We told our client that the application is now hosted on the web server. He requested to add documentation for the server setup in 
our repository, as well as additional documentation on how to run the application locally. A description of the local setup was given
to us at the start of the project in the form of a READ.md file.

### Meeting with the Kindertelefoon
Instead of a regular Thursday meeting, our next meeting with the client will be alongside the Kindertelefoon on Wednesday 14.
