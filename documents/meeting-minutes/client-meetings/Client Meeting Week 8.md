### User registration
Add some field where the user has to input a code. Only if the code is correct, may the user register a new account. The code can be static.

### Usability testing
The client explained that because of Responsible Research, we shoud not label our user testing session with Kindertelefoon as Usability Testing. It was an informal test, and the client says we should be clear about that in the report. 

### Feedback on progress 
The client mentions we could update how to set the application up locally, while keeping in mind the target audience. In the future, the code may be used by researchers with little experience in software engineering.
