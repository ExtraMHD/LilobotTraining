Time spent learning Vue was not as long as for the other frontend-related issues because installing the Userfront core library made creating the form easier. Only thing left to do is to connect it to the login pages by adding a link. |

BDI Spring Boot Application is able to run with a database also on the server. The current issue is that Rasa does not recognise the Rasa X installation. The setup took longer than expected due to the issues with installing all the Rasa components                                       |

Therefore, the remarks the same: 1. More checks can be added to check the validity of the username and the password. 2. Needs to be connected to the signup page via a link.                                                                                    |

## Main Problems Encountered

### Problem 1

**Description:** Although we completed most of the issues we intended to, by the end of the sprint most of these issues had not yet been merged.

**Reaction:** We will now have an internal deadline to have a merge request up by the end of Tuesday. Then parts of Wednesday can be used to merge review and implement the feedback.

### Problem 2

**Description:** Setting up Rasa on the server has taken longer than expected. Currently the Rasa X installation is still not recognised by Rasa.

**Reaction:** We have discussed this issue as a group and decided to shift our focus to migrating Rasa first before finalising the server hosting. This will allow us to skip trying to setup Rasa + Rasa X on the server and instead work with a more recent version of Rasa called Rasa Open Source. This newer version of the Rasa environment has more resources and better support to help with possible future issues with the setup. Moreover, trying to resolve the issue with Rasa X has been quite difficult to manage as the version we are currently working with is deprecated and therefore Rasa does not provide maintenance and support anymore (Rasa X (Community Edition) is no longer maintained or supported).

### Problem 2

**Description:** We did not give proper time estimates / weights for the issues so the work distribution could not be seen on GitLab.

**Reaction:** We have now added the time spent on GitLab (and estimates retrospectively) so that this can easily be viewed next to the issues. We will also give estimates for the issues when the issues are assigned in the sprint meeting.

## Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan
- Deadline for merge request being up on GitLab is Tuesday evening. 
- Add time estimates to issues at start of sprint.
