## Main Problems Encountered

### Problem 1
**Description:** Many issues are still not being merged before the sprint deadline. 

**Reaction:** We will assign slightly fewer new issues for this next sprint and have a focus on reviewing the outstanding merge requests at the start of the next sprint.

### Problem 2
**Description:** The path algorithm requires a lot of iterations of refactorings, since for many things it is not clear from the start how they can work, and what would be the nicest approach to it. This causes the reviewing process (among other things) to take long.

**Reaction:** If there are any new refactoring requests, these will be moved to another issue, so that the initial version can be merged soon.

## Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan
- Assign fewer tasks and catch up on merge reviews at start of sprint
