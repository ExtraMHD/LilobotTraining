| Testing the path algorithm classes                              | Fanni           | 15h (total estimate)          | 10h 30min (this sprint) | Almost, only three tests remaining (not merged)                                     | This issue was quite a lot of effort, since the path methods are for a big part complex to test. Some tests are very closely coupled to the code and required mocking of multiple methods/components. Two classes and some methods could not be tested at all since they provide “static data/functionality”. |
