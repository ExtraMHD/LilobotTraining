# A BDI-based Virtual Agent for Training Child Helpline Counsellors
This repository contains three applications. 

1. dktbdiagent - this is the BDI (web) application meant for deployment using Spring Boot. 
2. dktfrontend - this contains the Vue.js frontend application.
3. dktrasa - this is the Rasa application that handles the intent recognition of the user's messages.

# Instructions
This application can be run with Docker, or each component can be run individually. 
We recommend first trying to run the application through Docker, although this may be quite slow on your system. 
See how to run the application with Docker [here.](#running-the-project-with-docker) If you intend to host the application on a server, then ensure that the server's firewall is configured correctly [here.](#configure-firewall-on-the-server)

## Getting the repo on the server:
Follow these steps if you are attempting to setup the application on a server.
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html

Alternatively, you can use personal access tokens to clone the repo.
1. First, create a personal access token at: `https://<your-gitlab-domain>/-/profile/personal_access_tokens`
2. Clone the git repo with `git clone https://<username>:<access-token>@<your-gitlab-domain>/<project-name>.git`

# Running on server with docker

## Setup the environment
First, create the environment variables for the application to run in with a simple .env file
```
DKT_RASA_AUTH=test
DKT_DB_USER=postgres
DKT_DB_PASSWORD=password
DKT_SERVER_WEB=localhost:5601
DKT_SERVER_DB=localhost:5432
DKT_SERVER_RASA=localhost:5005
DKT_SERVER_ACTIONS=localhost:5055
DKT_SERVER_BACKEND=localhost:8080
DKT_SECRET=test
```
Specify the Rasa auth token and secret token the way you like.

## Build and run
Now you can build the image by running
```
docker-compose --env-file .env build
```
You can run the full application as a daemon in the backgrond
```
docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
```
To stop the application from running, run
```
docker-compose kill
```

# Running local or standalone on server

## Setting up Postgres database
### on local machine
1. Install a postgres server on your local machine. You can find instructions for this through a Google search.
2. Create database for BDI application.
```
CREATE DATABASE dktbase;
CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "dktbase" TO postgres;
 ```

3. Include the credentials of your database in the BDI application (in application.properties). The BDI application requires this, otherwise the application will crash.
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dktbase
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=password
```
You should be able to run your BDI application successfully now.

### On server
1. Configure a server instance.
2. Configure the [server firewall correctly.](#configure-firewall-on-the-server)
3. Install postgres. You can find instructions for this through a Google search.
   - This can be done by using the following commands, but it might differ for each case
   - `apt update` (ensures the serverâ€™s local package index is up-to-date)
   - ` apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib` (installs postgresql)
   - `systemctl start postgresql.service` (ensures the postgresql service is started)
   - `service postgresql status` (checks the status of the service, should display as being active)
4. Connect to the server using a postgres client to make sure everything works. I use psql.

   ```psql "host=<host url> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=<user> password=<password> sslmode=require"```

5. Create database for BDI spring application and configure access.

```
CREATE DATABASE dktbase;
CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "dktbase" TO postgres;
 ```

6. Include the credentials of your database in the BDI application (in application.properties) in your Github repository.
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<server-name>:5432/dktbase
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=password
```
You should be able to run your BDI application successfully now. A more secure option is to use Github password manager (or whatever software management tool you're using) to save the credentials instead so your password isn't exposed.


## Rasa
### Local
#### Installing Rasa
1. Install anaconda locally if you do not already have it: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html
2. Install python locally if you do not already have it. We used python 3.10: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
3. Create a new conda environment for rasa in the anaconda terminal.
   - `conda create --name rasa`
   - `conda activate rasa` to activate this environment
4. See Rasa documentation on how to install Rasa on your machine or follow the instructions below: https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/installing-rasa-open-source/
   - `pip3 install -U pip`
   - `pip3 install rasa`
   - `pip3 install rasa[spacy]`
   - `python3 -m spacy download nl_core_news_lg`
   - If these commands do not work, try with `pip` and `python`.

#### Running Rasa
- Essentially, there are two servers you need to run - the Rasa server for the intent recognition and the custom action server that communicates with the BDI application to retreive a response.
- In two separate anaconda terminals, activate the rasa environment with ```conda activate rasa```
- First CD into the ```/dktrasa``` folder
- To run the custom action server, use ```rasa run actions``` 
- Run the Rasa server in the other terminal using ```rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors  "*"```

### On Server
The following instructions describe how to run Rasa on the server.

#### System Specs
Below are the specs of the server that this was run on (with higher system load it is recommended to upgrade this):
  - Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40GHz
  - 4 GB System Memory
  - 47 GB Sysem Storage
  - Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

Some addresses need to be changed within the project to run the system on the server.
Navigate to `/dktfrontend/training-system-frontend/src/config.js` and change:
```js
const config = {
    agentServer: 'http://localhost:8080',
    agentWsServer: 'ws://localhost:8080/session',
    rasaServer: 'http://localhost:5005'
};
```
to:
```js
const config = {
    agentServer: 'http://{your.server.address}:8080',
    agentWsServer: 'ws://{your.server.address}:8080/session',
    rasaServer: 'http://{your.server.address}:5005'
};
```


1. Connect to server via SSH.
2. Install miniconda on the server by following these instructions: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
3. Install python with `sudo apt-get install python3.10`
4. Follow the instructions above for installing rasa at [installing rasa](#installing-rasa) from step 3
5. Run rasa by running the commands below in the `/dktrasa` folder:
   - To run the custom action server, use ```nohup rasa run actions &```
   - Run the Rasa server using ```nohup rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors  "*" &```
   - `nohup` ensures that the process does not die when leaving the ssh, and `&` sends the process to the background


## Frontend Web Application
### Local
1. Install npm at https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. CD to `/dktfrontend/training-system-frontend`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run serve`

The web app will be available at `http://localhost:5601`

### On Server
First, ensure that the frontend configuration is correct. 
Navigate to `/dktfrontend/training-system-frontend/src/config.js` and replace localhost with the server address.
1. Install Nginx:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get install nginx`
2. Change the line that starts with `root` in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to:
   - `root /<path-to-repo>/dktfrontend/training-system-frontend/dist;`
   - This can be achieved with `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to edit the file
3. Install nodejs and npm with:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
4. Navigate to `/<path-to-repo>/dktfrontend/training-system-frontend/`
   - `sudo npm install`
   - `sudo npm run build`
5. Start Nginx with: `sudo systemctl start nginx`

The frontend should be available at `http://<your-server-address>`


## Setting up BDI (Spring Boot) application
### Local
1. Open `/dktbdiagent` with an IDE of your choice as a Maven project. We used IntelliJ.
2. Ensure the postgres DB is running (instructions below).
3. Open `/dktbdiagent/src/main/java/com/bdi/agent/AgentApplication.java` and run the main method.

### On Server 
To run the java application on the server, a change must first be made in `src/main/java/com/bdi/agent/api/WebSocketConfig.java`.

The `registerStompEndpoints` method needs to be changed to:
```
@Override
    public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
        registry.addEndpoint("/session")
                .setAllowedOrigins("http://lilobottest.ewi.tudelft.nl);
    }
```

1. Install Maven with:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get install maven -y`
2. Install Java 16 with:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt install oracle-java16-installer`
3. Navigate to `/dktbdiagent`
4. Build the project with: `sudo mvn clean package`
5. Run the project with `nohup java -jar target/agent-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &`

# Configure firewall on the server
Each component of the application as their own associated port. 
You must ensure that the required ports are opened to allow for necessary communication between components and also between users and the components.
Below is a list of the components and their respective ports.
If desired the associated ports can be modified by changing the corresponding config files of the component (this is not recommended).
- Rasa server: port 5005
- Rasa actions server: port 5055
- Postgres database: port 5432
- Spring application: port 8080
- Vue.js frontend application: port 5601 if running locally and port 80 if running on the server

To configure the firewall correctly, the ports for the rasa server, spring application and frontend application must be opened.
1. Use `ufw status` or `ufw status verbose` to check the status of the firewall. You can run this command after each step to ensure that it was completed correctly.
2. `ufw show added` displays what rules were added to the firewall so far. You can also use this command after each step to ensure that it was completed correctly.
3. If you connect to the server via SSH, open the port used for it `ufw allow ssh`.
4. Enable the firewall `ufw enable`
5. Open all required ports (if the application configuration has not been changed then the required ports are: 5005, 8080 and 80).
Use `ufw allow <port-number>` to fully open the entered port. 
If allowing full access to the port is not desired, then the previous command can be extended to only allow access from specific locations. However, you must ensure that the required components can still access those ports.

# Running the project with Docker

The entire application with all components can also be run together with Docker. This will do the setup for you. 

Beware: the application can run much slower using Docker for Windows. 
To improve performance the application can be run directly in Ubuntu. See how to install Ubuntu for windows at https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#3-download-ubuntu

To be able to use the application with Docker, some addresses in the repo need to be changed.
 - In `dktbdiagent/src/main/resources/application.properties`\
Change first line:\
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dktbase`\
to:\
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/dktbase`

 - In `dktrasa/endpoints.yml`\
Change:\
`url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"` \
to:\
`url: "http://action-server:5055/webhook"`

- In `dktrasa/actions/actions.py`\
Change:\
`BDIAGENT_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/agent/"` \
`REPORT_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/report/"` \
to:\
`BDIAGENT_ENDPOINT = "http://dktbdiagent:8080/agent/"` \
`REPORT_ENDPOINT = "http://dktbdiagent:8080/report/"` 

1. Install docker desktop at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. Open command prompt and navigate to the project repo top directory. 
3. Run the command `docker-compose up`. This may take 5-30 minutes to build.
